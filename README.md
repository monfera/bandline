Invented by Stephen Few, "Bandlines use horizontal bands of color in the background of the plot area to display information about the distribution of values. This information is similar to that found in a box plot.  To do this you must gather information about how values related to the measure that will be featured in the sparkline are distributed during a period of history that usually extends further into the past than the values that will appear in the sparkline itself. [...] Bandlines may be modified to represent other meaningful ranges besides quartile-based distributions." - quoted from:

The example tser sampler generates a lot of outliers on purpose - to make them appear regularly, and to illustrate how outliers effect the bands.
